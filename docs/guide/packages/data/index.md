# @tachui/data

Data surfaces such as List, Menu, sectioned collections, and streaming adapters.

## Why it matters

- Virtualized lists for thousands of rows
- Menu + context menu components with nested sections
- Pull-to-refresh + swipe actions (shared with mobile roadmap)
- Designed to pair with responsive utilities and modifiers

## Testing focus

Currently only two test files cover this package. Expanding coverage to at least 10 suites (virtual scrolling, selection states, keyboard navigation, accessibility) is a Phase 1 deliverable so that we can recommend `@tachui/data` for production dashboards.

```bash
pnpm add @tachui/data@0.8.0-alpha
```
