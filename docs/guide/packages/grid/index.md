# @tachui/grid

Declarative CSS Grid layouts wrapped in SwiftUI-style APIs. Combine with responsive modifiers to ship dashboards and adaptive UIs quickly.

## Features

- Lazy grids (horizontal + vertical)
- Section headers, sticky columns
- Breakpoint-aware templates
- Grid performance helpers (virtualization, chunked rendering)

```bash
pnpm add @tachui/grid@0.9.0
```

Next steps: revisit the [grid overview](/guide/grid-overview) and [performance guide](/guide/grid-performance-guide) while we port the content here during Phase 2.
