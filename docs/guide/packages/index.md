# Packages

tachUI ships as 16 focused packages so you can scale from the 16 KB runtime to the full desktop toolchain. Each package page contains installation steps, APIs, and migration notes.

> API references are contextual—use the package pages below (or their README copies) for TypeDoc links instead of a monolithic global API.
