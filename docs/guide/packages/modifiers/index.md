# @tachui/modifiers

130+ chainable modifiers covering layout, typography, interaction, visual effects, accessibility, and responsive helpers.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @tachui/modifiers@0.8.0-alpha
```

## Categories

- **Layout**: padding, frame, grids, alignment, spacing
- **Appearance**: background, gradients, borders, shapes
- **Typography**: font, size, weight, tracking, case
- **Interaction**: hover, focus, gestures (drag/magnify in progress)

> ℹ️ Typography/responsive suites still have 14 skipped tests—Phase 2 of the docs refresh highlights these gaps so we can close them before 1.0.
