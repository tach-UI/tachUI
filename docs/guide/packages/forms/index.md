# @tachui/forms

Rich form components (inputs, selection controls, formatting helpers) with a validation pipeline designed for accessibility.

## Capabilities

- 27 components: TextField, SecureField, EmailField, CreditCardField, DatePicker, Stepper, Slider, Toggle, CheckboxGroup, RadioGroup, etc.
- Validation rules (sync + async) with helpful error messaging.
- Formatters for credit card, phone, postal code, SSN.
- Works seamlessly with modifiers and responsive utilities.

## Roadmap

- `useFormState` + `useFormValidation` hooks — stubs exist in `packages/forms/src/utils/index.ts`.

```bash
pnpm add @tachui/forms@0.8.0-alpha
```
