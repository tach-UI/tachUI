# API overview

Structured TypeDoc output will rejoin this section shortly. Until then, use these landing pages to find the right module.

- [Runtime](/api/runtime) – signals, effects, lifecycle
- [Components](/api/components) – common props + lifecycle hooks
- [Modifiers](/api/modifiers) – fluent builder and typings
- [Utilities](/api/utilities) – helpers provided with the core/runtime packages

> CI work in Phase 2 will regenerate TypeDoc into `/api/typedoc` and wire Algolia search to this structure.
