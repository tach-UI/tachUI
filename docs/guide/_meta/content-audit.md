# Content audit (Phase 1)

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home / showcase / roadmap | ✅ | New landing experience plus Phase 1 roadmap notes |
| Guide fundamentals | ⚠️ | Legacy content still accurate but references “v1.4”; needs rewrite |
| Packages | 🚧 | Placeholder pages created for core/primitives/modifiers/navigation etc. Need to ingest README content |
| API reference | 🚧 | Landing pages live; waiting on `pnpm docs:api` automation |
| Playground | 🚧 | Iframe + Vue component built; tachUI-powered app pending |
| Demo pages | ✅ | Calculator + Intro write-ups ported |
| Cheat sheets | 🚧 | Quick tables added; full reference to migrate from `/sheets/*` |
| Resources | ✅ | Community + tooling entries seeded |

Use this table when prioritizing migration issues. Update it as each section crosses from placeholder to fully migrated.
