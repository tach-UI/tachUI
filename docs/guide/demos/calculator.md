# Calculator demo

- Location: `/Users/whoughton/Dev/tach-ui/tachUI/demos/calculator`
- Bundle: 67 KB gzipped
- Components: 13
- Highlights: keyboard shortcuts, history tape, theme switcher

```bash
pnpm --filter calculator dev
```

Focus areas for Phase 2:

- Reduce console logging prior to production builds
- Expand tests beyond the store (component behaviors, keyboard matrix)
- Embed annotated source snippets into `/in-action/interactive`
