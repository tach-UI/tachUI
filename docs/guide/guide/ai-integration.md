# AI Integration

*This guide is coming soon. We're planning comprehensive AI integration features for TachUI development.*

TachUI is being designed with AI-first development in mind, providing intelligent tools and integrations to accelerate web development.

## Planned Content

This guide will cover:

- **AI-Powered Component Generation** - Generate components from descriptions
- **Smart Code Completion** - Context-aware suggestions and auto-completion  
- **Intelligent Refactoring** - AI-assisted code optimization and restructuring
- **Performance Optimization** - Automated performance improvements
- **Accessibility Enhancement** - AI-powered accessibility improvements
- **Code Review Integration** - AI code analysis and suggestions
- **Design-to-Code** - Converting designs to TachUI components

## Vision for AI Development

```bash
# Generate components from natural language
tacho generate "a user profile card with avatar, name, and social links"

# Optimize existing code
tacho optimize --ai UserProfile.tsx

# Accessibility improvements
tacho a11y --enhance components/

# Performance analysis
tacho analyze --ai --performance
```

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **In Planning** - AI integration features are currently in the planning and research phase.

### Research Areas

- **Component Generation** - Using LLMs to generate TachUI components
- **Code Understanding** - AI models trained on TachUI patterns  
- **Performance Analysis** - ML-powered performance optimization
